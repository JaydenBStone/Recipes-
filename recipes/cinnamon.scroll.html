    <h1>Cinnamon Scroll</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
    <p>Soft, fluffy cinnamon rolls made from scratch with a dump-and-mix dough that requires no kneading! Frosted with a
      sticky cream cheese glaze, these are sweet but nowhere near as sickly sweet as store bought ones. This recipe is
      quite forgiving – see notes. Instructions are long because I’m providing helpful hints but this recipe is actually
      quite straight forward! Recipe video below.</p>

    <h1>How to make Cinnamon Scrolls</h1>
    <h4>Buns</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the yeast and 2 teaspoons of the sugar in a medium bowl, then pour in water. Leave for 5 minutes until it froths.</li>
      <li>Place 600g/20oz flour, remaining sugar and salt in a bowl. Mix to combine</li>
      <li>Make a well in the centre. Add milk, butter, eggs and pour in the yeast liquid, including all froth.</li>
      <li>Mix until combined with wooden spoon – it will be like a sticky muffin batter, not kneadable.</li>
      <li>Rise # 1: Cover with cling wrap and place in a warm place (25C/77F+) to rise for around 1 1/4 – 1 1/2 hrs or until almost tripled in volume. Dough surface should be bubbly</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Making Rolls & Rise</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Line a 31.5 x 23.5 cm / 9 x 13″ tray with baking paper with overhang.</li>
      <li>Mix cinnamon and sugar in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Uncover dough, mix with spoon to deflate.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle half Extra Flour on work surface, pour dough on, sprinkle over remaining Extra Flour. Use hands to incorporate the flour into the dough – it may not absorb it all (or need more), the dough will stop absorbing flour when it’s no longer sticky, should be soft, pliable.</li>
      <li>If work surface is now flour free, sprinkle with more flour.</li>
      <li>Shape dough into log, then roll out into 28 x 48 cm / 11 x 19″ rectangle</li>
      <li>Pour over butter, then brush all over, then sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.</li>
      <li>Roll up firmly, then shape into an even log.</li>
      <li>Cut into 12 pieces (4cm / 1.6″), then place on tray (3 x 4).</li>
      <li>Cover with tea towel then place in warm place for 40 minutes or until almost doubled.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Baking & Frosting</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F (standard) or 160C/320F (fan / convection). Place shelf in the middle of the oven.</li>
      <li>Bake for 20 minutes, rotating the tray at 16 minutes.</li>
      <li>Buns are ready when the middle rolls are golden and the outer ones are deep golden on the edges. Tap the middle ones – they should sound hollow.</li>
      <li><em>Optional:</em> Brush with 1 tbsp / 15g melted butter to remove any residual flour spots.</li>
      <li>Use paper overhang to lift rolls onto cooling rack (key step – Note 5). Cool for 1 hour (will still be warm).</li>
      <li>Use a spoon to frost with glaze. Best served warm!</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Glaze</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Place butter, cream cheese and vanilla in a bowl. Beat until smooth (10 – 15 seconds).</li>
      <li>Add icing sugar, beat to incorporate. Add enough milk to make it a consistency that can be spooned over the buns and it drips slightly</li>
    </ol>
